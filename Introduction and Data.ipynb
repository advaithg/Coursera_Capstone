Introduction\n\n### 1.1: Background\n\nDriving a car always comes with the risk of an accident. Over 5 million car accidents occur every year in the United States of America. These accidents are in varying degrees of severity, with some only resulting in light injuries whereas others causing death.\n\nCar accidents happen due to a variety of causes, be it traffic, or speeding, or even bad weather. These factors combine with the level of carelessness of the driver in deciding how severe or dangerous a car accident is.\n\n### 1.2: Problem\n\nThe causes of accidents are extremely varied and thus we cannot account for all of them on our own whenever getting on a vehicle. Accidents result not only in a loss on the part of the occupants of the cars in terms of medical bills and injuries, but also involved insurance payments, loss of productivity and time. If an accident could be anticipated for and prevented before it occurs, a large amount of time and money would be saved, mainly for the occupants of the vehicle.\n\nThus the problem to be solved is: <b> Can the severity of a car accident be predicted? </b>\n\nTo do this, we need to answer the following questions:\n<ol>\n    <li> What and how much data is needed?\n    <li> What factors must be taken into consideration?\n    <li> How much influence do each of these factors have on the target of prediction?\n    <li> What model is to be used?\n    <li> How accurate is the model used?\n</ol>\n\n### 1.3: Interest\n\nThis problem would be of interest to people who regularly travel in their own vehicles, as learning of the possibility of an accident might induce them to be more careful while driving, avoiding injuries, damage or loss of life. The problem would also be of interest to the city traffic police department, so that they can gauge the possible severity of an accident and respond in kind to prevent it beforehand. Finally, insurance companies would also benefit from not having to pay auto insu"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "## 2. Data\n\n### 2.1 Source\n\nThe data used for this project is a database of the details of accidents in <b>Seattle City</b>, Washington, United States of America, including types and severity.<br>\nThe organization providing this data is <b>SDOT Traffic Management Division, Traffic Records Group</b> and the database is updated weekly.\n\nA description of the data can be found <a href='https://s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/cf-courses-data/CognitiveClass/DP0701EN/version-2/Metadata.pdf'>here</a>. <br>\nThe data can be downloaded <a href='https://s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/cf-courses-data/CognitiveClass/DP0701EN/version-2/Data-Collisions.csv'>here</a>.\n\n### 2.2 Description\n\nThe data consists of 38 columns of which a variety can be dropped. Columns containing incident keys, police codes, lane and street keys are all dropped to narrow it down to relevant columns. Columns with large amounts of missing data, or columns which cannot be adjusted properly will be dropped.\nThe location, weather, fatalities, severity, speeding status, whether the driver was inattentive, whether the driver was under the influence, and the road and light conditions are among the relevant columns to the problem of predicting severity.\n\nThe data will be analysed for all relevant columns using visualization to determine the relationship with the severity. Then the relevant columns can be tested with multiple possible machine learning models with each model being evaluated using multiple metrics. Then finally the model with the best overall accuracy will be considered and used to predict the severity of an accident.\n\nAn example of this data would be an accident that happened on 25th April 2020 on NW 65th ST at a block. The dataset tells us it was of severity 1, meaning only property damage occured, and also tells us that it hit a parked car. The vehicle had 2 people in it with no pedestrians involved. The dataset also tells us that the weather was overcast, with the road being wet and that the lighting condition was dark with street lights on. We also know that the vehicle was not speeding."}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.6", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.6.9", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
